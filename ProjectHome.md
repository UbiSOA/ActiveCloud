ActiveCloud is a middleware for fast and flexible creation and deployment of applications using an heterogeneus set of data sources, such as those typically found on an ubicomp environment, with an emphasis on Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs).

ActiveCloud allows the developer to focus on the application and  forget about low level details like new hardware support, communication with different devices, event polling, network administration and result notification.

The main architecture of ActiveCloud is designed with extensibility in mind; allowing the application developer to seamlessly add new hardware by using the right "capsule" to add support for a new device at runtime. Also, the integrated notification service allows making simple WSAN applications without writing a single line of code.

ActiveCloud is part of the UbiSOA family of projects, along with TinySOA, which bring WSN and ubicomp technologies into the mainstream.
